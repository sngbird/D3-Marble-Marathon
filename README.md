# D3-Marble-Marathon

Prototyping requirements:
Sketch your level designs and summary screens with Google Slides.
Identify 2+ YouTube videos that provide a visual reference for the kind of motion or game mechanics you want to implement.
Identify 2+ Phaser code examples that will provide a code reference for what you will implement.

Process requirements:
Your GitHub repository must show a history of incremental commits with useful commit messages, tracing back to an empty repository at the start.
Your README.md file describes:
Where to play your game (a link to your deployed game)
How your design satisfies the experience requirements below
How all of your data assets (if you have any) were created

Gameplay/Experience requirements
The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player
The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact).
3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass).
Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes
