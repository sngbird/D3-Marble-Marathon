Assets:
The marbles were pictures of actual marbles that i had, and edited in Krita,
the Platform and Door assets I drew myself in krita.


Gameplay/Experience requirements:

The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player
The gameplay is based entirely around mouse control, first the player clicks on the ball (discrete: on), drags the ball to stretch the slingshot(continuous), and then launches by releasing the mouse click (discrete: off).

The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact).
The ball can only be controlled by launching

3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass).
Level1, Level2, Level3

Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes
